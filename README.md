# Python Machine Learning A-Z 

This is a repo that I will be using to detail and commit code as I progress through a udemy ML/R course, this repo will be the Python repo. I intend to commit and add code as I go through the course, altering the steps as needed, context and thought process will be displayed largely through commit messages, so if you are looking for how I think, that's the place to check out. 

> I intend to use this repo in a way that ensures I'm learning the content, I will be committing often in order to create good dev habits and also to test myself, as i approach new content, I will be attempting to write solutions completely by myself first, then I will be "checking my answers" by studying how it is written in the tutorial. 

#### Thoughts as I've progressed through the content
> Python is a lot less clear to write solutions with in comparison to R.
> Scientific IDE's are fucking fantastic in comparison to a lot of pure developer environments. Everything is there from the get go.

### Building Models
* P-Values = 

* Significance Levels = So typically SL ranges from 0.05 to 0.15, chosen by the model builder, SL is a number we create in order to try and quantify the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (the hypothesis we are trying to prove) when it is true. 
> Example: We are a pharmaceutical company testing claims on a new drug we have created, we have advertised that it reduces symptoms, we set a SL of 0.01 and test for the symptom reduction, the null hypothesis in this situation is no change in symptoms, when we record a change, we then can say the claims (the hypothesis) are correct.
