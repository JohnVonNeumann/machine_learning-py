# Python Machine Learning A-Z 

This is a repo that I will be using to detail and commit code as I progress through a udemy ML/R course, this repo will be the Python repo. I intend to commit and add code as I go through the course, altering the steps as needed, context and thought process will be displayed largely through commit messages, so if you are looking for how I think, that's the place to check out. 

> I intend to use this repo in a way that ensures I'm learning the content, I will be committing often in order to create good dev habits and also to test myself, as i approach new content, I will be attempting to write solutions completely by myself first, then I will be "checking my answers" by studying how it is written in the tutorial. 

#### Thoughts as I've progressed through the content
> Python is a lot less clear to write solutions with in comparison to R.
> Scientific IDE's are fucking fantastic in comparison to a lot of pure developer environments. Everything is there from the get go.
